# Responsive Hero Section Project

## About the Project
This is a simple hero section project I built to practice responsive web design.  
It is designed to adapt beautifully across mobile phones, tablets (iPads), and desktop screens.  
The goal was to learn how to use **flexbox**, **media queries**, and **positioning** effectively for modern websites.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Visual Studio Code
- Git and GitHub for version control

## What I Learned
- Structuring a hero section using Flexbox
- Centering content using modern CSS methods
- Creating mobile-first responsive designs with media queries
- Using Git commands to manage my projects
- Publishing projects publicly using GitHub

## My Learning Journey
I'm documenting my journey as I learn and improve my frontend development skills.  
Each project I upload shows the steps I'm taking to master **responsive web design** before moving to advanced layouts, animations, and frameworks.
